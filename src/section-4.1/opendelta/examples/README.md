# Use Examples

This repo mainly contains several running scripts to use OpenDelta to conduct parameter-efficient training of various tasks.

**Note that we suggest adding OpenDelta to existing scripts, instead of modify a scripts into the following examples. OpenDelta itself doens't restrict the training pipeline nor provide pipeline.**


## tutorial
Several toy tutorials:
1. The scripts for docs/basic_usage
2. Using interactive module selection
3. Work with [OpenPrompt](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenPrompt)
